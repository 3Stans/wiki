## Mappning Snabbstart
> Wikin är dina byggstenar, gemenskapen är din inspiration, och du är kreativiteten.

Great mappers are not made in a day. It takes dedication with no one really able to hold your hand. The best we can do is provide you the tools with this wiki and clarify any questions you have to succeed in your mapping career!

1. Ladda ner de nödvändiga verktygen: en [ljudredigerare](https://www.audacityteam.org/) och en [nivåredigerare](#map-editing-resources).
2. [Konfigurera din ljudfil](#audio-editing-resources), hitta och bekräfta rätt BPM, och exportera i OGG-format.
3. Set up your song in your mapping editor (steps vary by editor but here's the [user guide](./mediocre-map-assistant.md) for MMA2).
4. Get mapping! Review [basic mapping practices](./basic-mapping.md) before you start. [Playtest](#playtesting) your own work early and often while mapping.
5. Get lighting! Review [basic lighting information](#lighting-practices). Simple manual lighting is easier than you think!
6. Get your map [playtested](#playtesting)! Third-party playtesting via the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) is highly recommended to get constructive feedback and to get past your own "map blindness."
7. Once your song has been mapped, lighted, and playtested you’re ready to [release](#publishing-songs) your song to the world on BeatSaver.

## Resurser för ljudredigering
Before mapping, you need to get your audio file ready so that it works with your map editor. This section will walk you through how to set up and edit your audio file using a free program called [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

### [**Grundläggande ljudkonfiguration**](./basic-audio.md)
Can't make a map without audio. Learn how to setup your audio for easy mapping!

### [**Avancerad ljudredigering**](./advanced-audio.md)
A deeper dive in adjusting audio files such as making shorter versions or working with variable BPM.

## Resurser för redigering av banor

### Nivåredigerare i gemenskapen
::: warning Community editors often have more features and don't require a VR headset, but they can be buggy, so use with caution. ::: Keyboard shortcuts for these editors are available inside their respective in-editor menus with a cross-reference between all of them [available here](./editor-keybinds.md).

#### Mediocre Map Assistant 2
MMA2 is the most feature rich 3D editor and is used by the majority of the mapping community.

* [Nedladdning av Mediocre Map Assistant 2](https://git.bsmg.wiki/Top_Cat/MediocreMapAssistant2/releases/latest)
* [Mediocre Map Assistant 2 användarhandbok](./mediocre-map-assistant.md)

#### Beatmapper.app
A 3D editor that runs in the browser, allowing anyone with a web browser to map. It works best for standard mapping without any extensions, but new features are being added.

* [Beatmapper Website](https://beatmapper.app/)
* [Beatmapper User Manual](https://beatmapper.app/docs/manual/getting-started)

#### ChroMapper - *Kommer snart*
A 3D editor that has stellar support for lighting, Chroma RGB, and shares similar assets with Beat Saber, allowing for a more accurate preview. ChroMapper is currently in closed beta with no planned public release date.

::: tip Interested in making your own editor or converter? You may find the [Map Format Page](./map-format.md) and the [SongCore Readme](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore/blob/master/README.md) helpful! :::

### Den officiella redigeraren
The official editor is developed and supported by Beat Games and pre-installed with the Steam VR or Oculus PC versions of Beat Saber. It makes playtesting convenient with one-click access to your work-in-progress in-game. The official editor is 2D and requires good visualization skills to translate well to a 3D play space, which can be challenging for new mappers. The vast majority of mappers use a [Community Editor](#community-editors).

* To access, launch the editor from within Beat Saber in your HMD or use fpfc launch parameters to open directly from your PC
* Check out Megalon's [Official Editor Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ex6sOEVgrM) for an overview of standard mapping!

Keep in mind the following features that official does not have compared to the [Community Editors](#community-editors) available.

* Ovanlig precision som 1/5 och tillhörande multiplar.
* Regelbunden autosave och återställning (nivåredigerare skapar autosaves endast vid testning eller sparande)
* Flexibel mass-select, kopiering och inklistring
* Redigera på plats (ändra riktningen på block utan att behöva ta bort dem)
* Stöd för Chroma RGB
* Ljudförskjutning för synkronisering med banor. (Parameterarna i den officiella redigeraren förskjuter/försenar inte bara låten utan även hitsounds)
* Felkontroll
* Medverkandefält
* Stöd för Mapping eller Noodle Extensions

#### Migrera från officiell redigerare till en Community Editor
Although it is recommended to start setup again following the [Quick Start](#mapping-quick-start) guides with a [Community Editor](#community-editors), it is possible to transfer your work in the Official Editor over.

1. Installera en [Community Editor](#community-editors)
2. Leta reda på dina banor i spelets `CustomLevels` -mapp.
    * Steam-exempel på plats: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
    * Oculus-exempel på plats: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
3. Flytta den till den mapp som din redigerare letar i. Detta är vanligtvis `CustomWIPLevels` i mappen `Beat Saber_Data`.
    * Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`
    * Oculus: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`
4. Konvertera din ljudfil till formatet `.ogg` från `.wav` om du inte har gjort det.
    1. Ladda ner och installera [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
    2. Öppna `.wav` -filen i Audacity
    2. Klicka på `File menu -> Export -> Export as OGG.`
    3. Namnge din fil `song.ogg` och klicka <kbd>Spara</kbd>.
    4. Placera filen `song.ogg` i nivåmappen.
        * Du behöver inte längre din `.wav` -fil i denna mapp
5. Öppna banan i din community editor och ändra namnet på låtfilen till `song.ogg` och klicka på spara.

You are now ready to continue editing your map!

## Mappningspraxis
> "You have to know the rules before you can break them."  
> \- Uninstaller

There is no holy bible of mapping but this section of the wiki includes a lot of tribal knowledge from the community on best practices at all levels of mapping. Our advice is to follow these rules until you're comfortable with your skills and then get creative, experiment, and innovate!

### [**Grundläggande mappning**](./basic-mapping.md)
All new mappers need to read this, **no exceptions!**

### [**Mer avancerad mappning**](./intermediate-mapping.md)
A more in-depth look at many mapping topics **(This page is still a work in progress!)**

### [**Utökad mappning**](./extended-mapping.md)
Mapping Extensions, Extra Characteristics, and 360&deg;/90&deg; mapping

### Mappningsrollen
To apply for the **Mapper** role on the [Beat Saber Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) you must have released three solid/playable maps (collaborations are acceptable) and complete the [Mapper Role Submission Form](https://forms.gle/mj66J3UopTykFJjXA). Your application and maps may take a decent amount of time to be reviewed and approved.

### Moddning & Rankning
Maps that meet specific [Ranking Criteria](https://scoresaber.com/criteria) and go through an intensive review process called "modding" have the potential to become ranked, awarding players Performance Points (PP) toward global leaderboards. More information and an in-depth FAQ is available on the [ScoreSaber Discord](https://discord.gg/WpuDMwU)

* Prior to requesting ranking, mappers should thoroughly review the ranking criteria and [metadata standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehotupIYMVlc8x41JldO-24m7Am-oTVYnciF9KCRdNM/edit) and have their map modded by a knowledgeable source.

:::tip Want an even more detailed look? Review the [Ranking Criteria](https://scoresaber.com/criteria) for some of the more ambiguous ranking considerations. :::

* Once your map has been modded and revised, it’s ready to be presented to a ranking team member or recruit to review.
* If the ranking team member deems the map acceptable it will be added to the ranking request queue to be voted on by the full ranking team.

## Belysningspraxis
A map is not finished until some form of lighting is included. Lighting can range from very basic to incredibly detailed using additional mods to enable more features.

### [**Grundläggande belysning**](./basic-lighting.md)
Learn the various aspects to lighting your map manually

### [**Mer avancerad belysning**](./intermediate-lighting.md)
Take your lighting skills a bit further into strobing, ring spins, and contrast practices

### [**Avancerad belysning**](./advanced-lighting.md)
Advanced and nuanced techniques, lighting for custom platforms, and Chroma RGB **(This page is still a work in progress!)**

### Ytterligare resurser

### Automatiskt ljus
Not ready to make your own lighting? Here are some programs to do it for you. Keep in mind, creating simple manual lighting is not difficult and will always be better at expressing the atmosphere of the song than using these programs.

* [Lolighter](https://github.com/Loloppe/Lolighter#readme) by **Loloppe#6435** - Standalone program for automated lighting and has other features to modify your map.
* **Lightmap** - It is integrated into Mediocre Map Assistant 2 and can be accessed in the error checker menu.

## Playtesting
Testing your work is a **critical** part of mapping. Testing as you work helps you adjust for major playability issues and get a feel for your map. [Third-party or "outside"](#community-third-party-testing) playtesting is when someone other than yourself tests your pre-release map and provides constructive feedback and is helpful in highlighting issues to which you may be "map blind."

::: danger You **DO NOT** need to upload your map to BeatSaver in order for you or anyone else to test. :::

* If your map is using the 1.0 song format (your files are .json and .ogg) you must convert your map using one of several available tools like [Songe Converter](https://github.com/lolPants/songe-converter) by lolPants or [BeatMapper Tools](https://mappers.beatmappertools.com/) by Darkuni. **Update your editor to MMA2 or Beatmapper**. See [Community Editors](.#community-editors) for links.
* If your map is using the 2.0 song format (your files are .dat and .ogg/.egg) you’re ready to test.

### Testa på en PC
Follow these steps to test any of your maps made with a community editor using PC-based VR.

1. Om din WIP-låtmapp inte redan finns i `Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels` så placera en kopia där.
2. Access your map in-game via the CustomWIPLevels category in the song pack menu. Use practice mode to play (the button next to the play button).

**Made changes to your map while the game is open?**  
Click on the game window. Then while you are on the Main Menu or Song Select Menu press <kbd>Ctrl + r</kbd> on your keyboard. Your changes will be loaded without needing to restart the game!

::::tip OBS

* You will need to have the **SongCore** mod installed in order to see the CustomWIPLevels category and use the <kbd>Ctrl + r</kbd> shortcut.
* Having duplicate map files in `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels` can cause problems.
* Using Online Websites to convert audio to `.ogg` may result in your audio file being treated as invalid and will not be loaded by the game! Using Audacity and following the steps in [Basic Audio Setup](./basic-audio.md) is the easiest way to ensure your map loads in-game. :::

### Testa på en Quest
Follow these steps to test any of your maps made with a community editor using an Oculus Quest. You must have [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) and [BMBF](https://bmbf.dev/stable) installed.

1. Zippa upp låten som vanligt, zippa filerna och inte själva mappen. [How to Video](https://streamable.com/u20ci)
   * If you are using [MMA2](#mediocre-map-assistant-2) there is a `Package To Zip` button you can use in the song info screen to do this for you.
2. Upprätta en anslutning till din Quest från din dator. Detta kan göras på två sätt, [trådbundet](#connect-wired-usb) eller [trådlöst](#connect-wirelessly).

#### Ansluta trådlöst

1. Öppna BMBF på ditt Oculus Quest. BMBF måste vara igång för att anslutningen ska lyckas.
2. Inuti BMBF gå till fliken `Tools`. Där bör du se en webbadress och ett versionsnummer som liknar vad som visas nedan. <br/>![ip](~@images/mapping/ip.png)
3. Öppna en modern webbläsare på din dator och skriv in adressen i sökfältet. You should be greeted with this screen below.<br/>![BMBF Web](~@images/mapping/bmbfweb.png)
4. Du är nu ansluten! Fortsätt på [Ladda upp testfil till Quest](#upload-test-file-to-quest)-stegen nedan.

#### Ansluta trådbunden USB

1. Anslut din Oculus Quest till datorn via USB och håll SideQuest öppet
2. Öppna BMBF på ditt Oculus Quest. BMBF måste vara igång för att anslutningen ska lyckas
3. Look at the top of SideQuest, which will give you the IP to get into BMBF. You can also access your IP through the Tools tab of BMBF.
4. Type into any web browser: "192.168.X.XXX:50000" with X being replaced with the IP displayed in SideQuest, or the Tools tab<br/>![Quest IP](~@images/mapping/quest_ip.png)  
   For example, from the picture you would enter `192.168.0.19:50000` into a web browser of choice (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
5. Du är nu ansluten! Fortsätt på [Ladda upp testfil till Quest](#upload-test-file-to-quest)-stegen nedan.

#### Ladda upp testfil till Quest

1. Dra och släpp filerna till BMBFs uppladdningssida (indikeras av /main/upload i slutet av länken)
2. När du har laddat upp filerna klicka på Sync to Beat Saber i det övre högra hörnet av sidan <br/>![BMBF Browser](~@images/mapping/bmbf_browser.png)
3. Access your map in-game via the Custom Songs playlist in the song pack menu. Use practice mode to play (the button next to the play button).

:::tip NOTE

* If after deleting an old copy of a map and reuploading it with a new version on a quest still results with the old version being played, rename the zip file before uploading it through BMBF.
* BMBF may have issues importing your map if your song file or cover image name contains `-` or spaces. You may need to rename these files and update the song info accordingly for a successful upload.
* Using Online Websites to convert audio to `.ogg` may result in your audio file being treated as invalid and will not be loaded by BMBF! Using Audacity and following the steps in [Basic Audio Setup](./basic-audio.md) is the easiest way to ensure your map loads in-game.
* If your song audio file was automatically converted to `.egg`, you may run into issues when uploading onto BMBF. Try renaming the `.egg` back to `.ogg`. :::

### Community / Tredjepartstestning
The `#testplays` channel in the [Beat Saber Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) makes it easy to have your work checked by knowledgeable mappers. Playtesters will provide constructive feedback on how to improve your map in either video or text format in a DM or in the `#mapping-discussion` channel.

:::warning Some things to note...

* Maps with less than 1 minute done will not get much feedback or be tested. Consider asking in `#mapping-discussion` to see if someone will take a look instead.
* Challenge/Super High difficulty maps may take longer to get feedback since there are not many playtesters at this skill level.
* Please keep to serious posts where you are looking to improve your mapping skills. Meme or Shitpost maps do not belong as they end up wasting the testplayers time. :::

1. Create a compressed .zip file of the individual song files.
    * If you are using [MMA2](./mediocre-map-assistant.md), you can press the `Package Song to Zip` button in the Song Info Settings to create a compressed .zip of your map.  
      ![Package Song to Zip button](~@images/mapping/mma2-package-zip.jpg)
    * If you are using [Beatmapper.app](#beatmapper-app), follow their [downloading instructions](https://beatmapper.app/docs/manual/publishing#downloading-your-map).
    * You can manually create the zip by following this [How to Video](https://streamable.com/u20ci) if you are not using a web based editor.
2. Upload your map to `#testplays` using the following format:

* **Map:** The name and artist of your map
* **Length:** The length of the song
* **BPM:** The BPM of the song
* **Difficulty:** Which difficulties are included
* **NPS:** The notes per second of each difficulty available
* **Feedback:** Any requests for feedback (specific difficulties to be tested, things to look for etc.)
* **Status:** What state is the map in? (i.e., First draft complete, no lights; 1:45 mapped; release candidate w/ lighting; etc.)

3. Testers will usually look at your map within 1-7 days and will use a number of reaction emojis (listed in `#testplays` pinned posts) to track testing status.

:::warning Remember: If you make changes after posting or getting feedback React with a 🛑 `:octagonal_sign:` to indicate stop testing this version :::

You can copy and paste the following template into Discord:

```txt
**Map:**
**Length:**
**BPM:**
**Difficulty:**
**NPS:**
**Feedback:**
**Status:**
```

### Help Playtest
Do you like the idea of playing new songs before they are ever released on BeatSaver? Do you want to help shape the mapping community? Consider becoming a testplayer! Check out the [How to Testplay](./how-to-testplay.md) guide to get started!

## Publicera låtar
Once your song has been mapped, lighted, and playtested and it’s a finished product you’re ready to release it to the world!

### BeatSaver
[BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/) is the public repository for all custom Beat Saber maps. Songs must be in the 2.0 song format (files are .dat and .ogg/.egg/.wav) to be uploaded.

#### Hur man släpper en bana

::: danger

* Please **DO NOT** upload an incomplete WIP map to BeatSaver!
  * Uploading to BeatSaver equates to "Putting it on the store shelf" and should **only** be your final version.
  * See the [Playtesting](#playtesting) section for instructions on testing your map. :::

1. [Create an account](https://beatsaver.com/auth/register) on BeatSaver.
    * Beatsaver usernames may only have alphanumeric characters and `-`. Usernames with spaces or `_` for example, are not allowed.
    * If you did not receive a verification email, fill out this [contact form](https://beatsaver.com/contact).  
      **Note** you must provide a valid username *and* the email used to sign up in the form to complete the verification!
2. Click the <kbd>Upload</kbd> link in the top-right.
3. Add your BeatSaver map name and map description. Only the map name is searchable so be sure to include song name, song artist, and other terms that might make it easier to find your map.
    * Use "tags" like (Chroma), (OneSaber), or (Mapping Extensions) if your map uses some special modifications or characteristics you want to highlight.
    * Putting a link to a playthrough video in the map description can help you get more downloads as it is easier to share your map to others and lets people know what to expect.
4. Add your .zip file and click the <kbd>Upload</kbd> button.

::: tip NOTE Map files currently cannot be updated on BeatSaver. If you need to upload a new version of your map you will need to delete the old one and re-post. :::

### BeatSaver Troubleshooting
Here are solutions for some common errors when uploading a Beatmap.  
Encountered something not listed here? Drop into `#mapping-discussion` for assistance.

:::danger Remember:

* You should have your map [playtested](#playtesting) before uploading!
* You do not need upload maps created by auto-generation software such as Deepsaber or Beat Sage to install them in your game. If you are on PC, you can unzip the files into your `CustomLevels` folder. If you are on Quest, follow the [Testing on a Quest](#testing-on-a-quest) steps to install the map. :::

**Beatmap does not contain an Info.dat file!**

* Usually caused by having the files in a subfolder. You need to zip the files instead of the folder. [How to Video](https://streamable.com/u20ci) Or use the handy export button in your editor instead. **NOTE: MMA2's export button does not include contributor images in the zip.**

---

**One or more beatmap difficulty files cannot be found!**

* You might have forgotten to include all of your difficulty files are in the zip.
* A difficulty's `"_beatmapFilename"` in the `Info.dat` might be using a different file name than what is present in the folder.
* A deleted difficulty is still being referenced in your `Info.dat` file. Check to make sure you do not have unintended difficulties in the `"_difficultyBeatmaps"` cluster of each present characteristic.

**Error in `MapDifficulty.dat`. Root should NOT have additional property: `_time`.**

`_time` is the common error for this type of message. However, the same solution applies if a different property is flagged.

* Your files are not compliant the map schema. See [Schema Change](#beatsaver-data-schema-change-october-27-2019) for solutions.

**Beatmap could not be parsed!**

* This could be caused by extreme server load. Try again later or ask in `#mapping-discussion`.

---

**Field `._customData._contributors[]._iconPath` contains an invalid filename.**

* Utilizing the contributors field requires all aspects to be included. Make sure all 3 aspects (Role, Name, iconPath) are filled and there is a unique square image for each iconPath entry in your zip.

#### BeatSaver Data Schema Change - October 27, 2019
BeatSaver now enforces a schema in order for your maps to be uploaded, of which public MediocreMapper is not compliant with. The most breaking change happened in the difficulty data files, where MM-specific fields were moved inside a `_customData` object.

**Resolution #1:**  
Switch to the [Mediocre Map Assistant 2](#mediocre-map-assistant-2) editor. Open each difficulty file and save it to correct the schema. Use MMA2 going forward.

**Resolution #2:**  
Use the [Schema Updater Utility](https://skystudioapps.com/mapping-tools/#schema-fixer) by **+1 Rabbit** to fix your files before uploading. Then switch to a [supported editor](#community-editors).

**Resolution #3 (The Hard Way):**  
If you wish to fix this yourself, here is a quick template which shows you where everything should go in order for your map to be compliant with BeatSaver's new schema.

Alternatively, since `_customData` is **NOT** a required field, you can go ahead and remove everything that would be placed in there, and upload that result.

```json
{
  "_version": "2.0.0",
  "_notes": [],
  "_obstacles": [],
  "_events": [],
  "_customData": {
    "_bpmChanges": [],
    "_bookmarks": [],
    "_time": 0
  }
}
```

To be compliant with the new schema, please also find and remove or fill in any **blank fields** in your `Info.dat` or difficulty files.

### Mapping Anxiety
If you're finding it difficult to muster up the courage to upload your map, or are finding it emotionally taxing coping with a lack of downloads or a lot of dislikes, you're not alone. Many mappers have experienced these feelings. You can read more about it on the [Coping with Mapping Anxiety](./mapping-anxiety.md) page.
