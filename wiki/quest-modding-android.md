# Installing BMBF with a Android Phone
If you **don't** have a PC and **can't** borrow one (please use [a PC instead](https://bsmg.wiki/quest-modding.html)) you can use your Android Phone.
This guide orients itself a bit on the [Quest modding guide](https://bsmg.wiki/quest-modding.html) and will **NOT** cover how to maintain scores if you update

::: danger DISCLAIMER
By choosing to use mods, you understand that:

* You may experience problems that don't exist in the vanilla game. 99.9% of bugs, crashes, and lag are due to mods.
* Mods are subject to being broken by updates and that's normal - be patient and respectful when this happens,
  as modders are volunteers with real lives.
* Beat Games aren't purposefully trying to break mods. They wish to work on the codebase and sometimes this breaks mods,
  but they are not out to kill mods.

Do not attack the game developers for issues related to mods, and vice versa -
modders and game developers are two separate groups. Just don't be a jerk ok.

## Requirements
- A Android Phone or Android Tablet (IPhones or IPads are not supported)
- A **paid** Version of Beat Saber on the Oculus Quest Store
- A Cable to connect your Quest to your Phone (If your phone is somewhat new the charger that was included with your Quest should work)

## Installation
1. Download the [bugjaeger app from the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.sisik.hackendebug&hl=gsw&gl=US)
2. Download the newest [BMBF APK from bmbf.dev/stable](https://bmbf.dev/stable)

## Enable Developer mode on your Quest
Follow [this written guide](https://github.com/ComputerElite/wiki/wiki/Enable-Developer-Mode-for-OQ)

## Enable Developer mode on your Phone
1. Go into your Android settings
2. Scroll to "About phone" and open it
3. Press "Software information"
4. Spam "Build number" until it says Developer mode enabled

## Enable USB debugging on your Phone
1. Go back to the settings
2. Press "Developer options"
3. Activate USB debugging

## Installing BMBF
After opening bugjaeger on your Phone connect your Quest with your phone. You should get a USB debugging pop-up in your Quest. Allow it and maybe even make it always allow it. You should also get a pop-up on your Phone. Allow that too. Now if bugjaeger picks your Quest up you install the BMBF APK by doing following:

After you pressed ok, allow file access and select the download APK file which should be labeled "com.weloveoculus.BMBF.apk". The apk file should now install to your Quest. Now make sure you ran Beat Saber once before progressing.

## Modding Beat Saber
after successfully installing BMBF onto your Quest you should be able to find it in your Quests library under unknown sources.

![UnknownMenu](https://github.com/ComputerElite/wiki/blob/main/bugjaeger/UnknownMenu.jpg)

open it and allow file access after after starting it if it asks you. Now follow the on-screen instructions carefully. After you finished you should see [BeastSaber](https://bsaber.com).

If at any point during the install process, you get the Restore App popup just click Close. This warning is more directed to pirated versions of the game so if you're just modding there will likely be no consequences for ignoring it.

**From here on you can follow the [official guide](https://bsmg.wiki/quest-modding.html#installing-mods)**
