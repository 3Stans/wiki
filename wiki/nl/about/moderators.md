# Moderators
With a server so large, a lot of moderation is required to keep everything under control. You can thank this team for keeping the streets clean.

## BeigeAnimal
We had to whip this boy into a bit of shape but he's now one of the most effective moderators. He's not really specialized in any field but he's willing to lend a helping **provided they ask in the right channel.** Also hates sketchfab links.

"My dad worked for years as an admin, but he got laid off when bots took over. He came home that night and told me we had to move into the van, since we couldn't afford rent anymore, then he beat the shit out of me with jumper cables. Shitposting should be legal."
