# PC 모딩

## Preface

::: danger 위험 고지 사항 모드를 사용함으로써 다음을 이해할 수 있다.

* 기본모드에서 존재하지 않는 문제들을 경험할 수 있습니다. 버그,충돌,지연의 원인은 99.9% 모드입니다.
* Mods are subject to being broken by updates and that's normal - be patient and respectful when this happens, as modders are volunteers with real lives.
* Beat Games aren't purposefully trying to break mods. They wish to work on the codebase and sometimes this breaks mods, but they are not out to kill mods.

Do not attack the game developers for issues related to mods, and vice versa - modders and game developers are two separate groups. 그냥 멍청하게 굴지마세요. :::

비트세이버는 기본적으로 커스텀송을 지원하므로 원하는 곡만 있으면 더 이상 모드가 필요하지 않습니다. It's a wise idea to install `SongCore` though, as this mod expands upon the base game functionality to improve loading times and provide functionality for other mods like the in-game downloader, custom leaderboards, playlists, etc.

::: warning I watched this video by Elite Eric, but I got stuck/it didn't work. 왜 BSMG 에서는 Elite Eric 의 튜토리얼 사용에 대해 강력하게 반대합니다. After reviewing much of his content, they contain a large amount of incomplete, erroneous, or straight up incorrect information. Attempts to reach out to him to correct these errors has unfortunately been met with silence and new (also incorrect) tutorials.

## Installers

### 모드 어시스턴트 ( Mod Assistant )
> **현재 권장되는 모드 설치 프로그램입니다.**

__**모드를 설치하기전에 **** 한 번 이상 게임을 실행해주세요! 이것은 게임을 다시 설치하는 것에도 적용됩니다.

A simple Beat Saber Mod Installer similar to the mod manager, but with additional features such as mod removal and version checking! 어시스턴트 GitHub 링크 [>>클릭<<](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest)

![Mod Assistant](~@images/beginners-guide/modassistant.png)

## How to get more songs
::: tip Most maps in the "Top All", "Rating", "Downloads" or "Plays" sort filters were created before good mapping practices were established. Try downloading songs released between late 2019 and now to get the best custom levels experience. :::

::: warning It is a good idea to backup your `CustomLevels` folder periodically as there is a small chance it will be reset if the game updates!

This folder is located in your game install: `Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels` :::

### 인게임 다운로더 ( In-Game Downloader )
The `BeatSaver Downloader` mod allows you to download maps in-game using the `MORE SONGS` menu button on the `MODS` menu screen. This pulls maps directly from [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com)

### BeatSaver
[BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com) is the master repository of custom songs made by the community. Many other tools and sites enhance the experience of downloading custom songs, but this site is where they are stored. To install songs downloaded from the site, unzip them into a folder and place it into `Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels`. You can also use the in-game downloader mod, or Mod Assistant's OneClick™ Install feature.

### Beast Saber
[Beast Saber](https://www.bsaber.com) (bsaber.com) is a site that tries to help make finding fantastic maps to play easier. It does this by categorizing the thousands of songs on beatsaver and lets you sort by a song's genre and many other attribute tags. It also has a full social feature where players can review songs and comment on them. One of the most used features is the "Curator Recommended" feature where a team plays through most songs released each day and recommends the ones that stand out, letting you [automatically download these in-game](https://bsaber.com/beatsync/).

### 노래 관리 앱

There are no working song management apps available at this time.

### 플레이리스트 ( Playlists )
You need to install the [PlaylistManager](https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistManager/releases/latest) mod.

Then you can either:

* Use the `Install Playlist` tool in the Options tab of Mod Assistant.
* Place the playlist file into `Beat Saber/Playlists`, select it in-game, then hit download all songs.

You should see the playlist next to the Custom Levels album's in-game. The mod also supports managing playlists in-game.

## 수동 설치
A mod installer is the recommended way to install mods. See the section [above](#installers). If you have patched the game and just need to install mods that are not available in the installer, skip to step 4.

**Run the game at least once** before trying to mod the game! This applies to reinstalling your game too.

### BSIPA 설치방법

1. 다운로드 [BSIPA](https://github.com/bsmg/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded/releases).
2. Navigate to your [install folder.](#install-folder) and extract the contents of BSIPA into it. ![Directory Clean](~@images/beginners-guide/directory-clean.png "Directory Clean") ![Directory Ipa](~@images/beginners-guide/directory-ipa.png "Directory Ipa")
