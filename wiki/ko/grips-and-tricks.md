## 랭킹 올리기 튜토리얼
PP를 얻는 데 도움을 주는 TeknozFR의 믿을 수 없는 글. [랭킹 & 고득점 가이드](./ranking-guide)

## 고득점
[Cube Community YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdG9zS8jVcQIKl7plwWXUkg) 이 영상을 통해 어떻게 점수 시스템이 작동하는지 알 수 있습니다.

추가로, 이 [이미지](https://twitter.com/Split82/status/979365834324889600)를 보면 히트박스가 어떻게 작동하는지 확인할 수 있습니다.

## 랭킹
*세계 랭킹은 어떻게 작동하나요? Performance points는 또 뭔가요? 괄호 안의 숫자는 대체 무엇이죠? 왜 저의 PP는 이렇게 적나요?*

[ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com/global)에서 닉네임을 검색하면, 여러분의 글로벌 랭킹과 PP를 확인할 수 있습니다. Scoresaber 계정은 스팀 / 오큘러스 유저명과 연동되죠.

1. 랭크 맵에는 PP가 할당되어 있습니다 (PP = performance points). PP 수치는 랭크 곡을 클리어했을 때의 정확도에 의해 결정됩니다. 랭크 맵에 어느 정도의 PP가 매겨지는가는 우리의 귀여운 판다인 Umbranox가 개발한 비밀 알고리즘을 통해 결정됩니다.
2. To avoid having skilled players grinding lots of easier songs that are worth less PP, a curve is applied to your plays. This curve is 0.965^(x-1) where x is the position of that score on your song list. e.g. If your top play is a 260 PP play, you will be rewarded 260 weighted PP which is a 100% of the raw PP of that play. If your second top play is 247 raw PP, you will be rewarded 238 weighted PP which is the actual amount of PP you get after the curve applies. Here is a list of my current top 4 plays where the raw PP is in italic and the weighted PP is in bold.

| Raw PP | Weighted PP                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 260pp  | **260pp** (100% of raw PP)   |
| 247pp  | **238pp** (96.5% of raw PP)  |
| 246pp  | **229pp** (93.1% of raw PP)  |
| 244pp  | **219pp**  (89.9% of raw PP) |

3. To rank up, get scores on new songs that are worth more or a similar amount of PP to your top scores. When you don't have any new high PP songs to play, replay songs on your first pages to get better scores. Here is a [spreadsheet by DuoVR](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ufWgF2tWS0gD3pIr0_d37EkIcmCrUy1x6hyzPEZDPNc/edit#gid=1775412672) of all the ranked songs and how much PP they are worth. This list is updated every 24 hours.

Here is another site by [DuoVR](https://duovr.github.io/BigPP/) where you can input your scoresaber profile and it shows you songs that you should play for a lot of PP.

## 컨트롤러 그립법
Cube Community made some videos showing off some of the more popular grips for Oculus Touch controllers (CV1) and Vive Wands.

### HTC Vive 컨트롤러

### Oculus Rift S and Quest
아직 Rift S와 퀘스트 컨트롤러를 위한 영상은 제작되지 않았지만, 아래에서 몇몇 그립의 예시를 찾아 볼 수 있습니다. ![Oculus Rift S/Quest Guide](~@images/grips-and-tricks/touch2-grips.jpg)

### Valve Index Controllers
A video has not yet been made for Index controllers, but you can find some examples in their `#tips-and-grips` channel! [CC Discord](https://discord.gg/dwe8mbC)

### Oculus Quest 2
A video has not yet been made for the Quest 2's controllers, but you can find some examples below! ![Oculus Quest 2](~@images/grips-and-tricks/touch3-grips.jpg)

Check out Cube Community's `#tips-and-grips` channel for more suggestions and examples in their [Discord](https://discord.gg/dwe8mbC). Please remember that everyone's playstyle and body is different; someone else's grip might not work exactly like you need it to. Don't be afraid to experiment and find what's right for you!

## Improve Vive controller tracking
Your body may be blocking one lighthouse from seeing one of your controllers. Here are some steps that may help improve tracking.

1. Move into the corner of your playspace.
2. Rotate your body 45 degrees so that your lighthouses can see both controllers.
3. Rotate the room within Beat Saber's settings to compensate, so that you appear facing forward within the game.

This can apply to oculus sensors too.

## Touch Controller Battery Disconnect
The force of your swings in Beat Saber can cause the spring in the touch controllers to compress and disconnect the battery for a brief moment. This is what happens when you see your saber lose positional tracking but still rotate in place. To alleviate this, ragesaq recommends adding extra springs inside the battery compartment to decrease the likelihood of battery disconnects happening, explained in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/a2h7o4/psa_adding_an_additional_spring_to_the_battery/?st=JR9Q7OEZ&sh=a7a3d091)
