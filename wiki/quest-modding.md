# Quest Modding

## Installation 

Currently the only recommended way to install custom songs and mods is BMBF sideloaded with SideQuest.
* [BMBF apk](https://bmbf.dev/stable)

### Installing BMBF with SideQuest

If you haven't already, download and setup [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/#/setup-howto)

Open SideQuest and connect your Quest to your PC. If you've previously modded Beat Saber or have scores you want to backup, go to `My Apps` located in the top bar of the window and find Beat Saber.

Click the cog next to it then press the `BACKUP GAME DATA` button, if you have a modded game you also need to uninstall it by pressing the `UNINSTALL APP` button.

You can later restore your save from the same menu, after modding.

Install the latest BMBF apks via the `Install APK from folder` button shown below.

Once they've successfully installed, make sure you have the latest version of Beat Saber installed and unmodded. 
:::warning
Run Beat Saber once and close it before modding!
:::

After running Beat Saber once, open BMBF from Oculus TV channels tab or Unknown Sources in your library. Follow each step exactly as you're told, and then you should be see [bsaber.com](https://www.bsaber.com). This is where you can download any custom songs available.

## Restoring save data

### Restoring from SideQuest

Go back to the same menu you used to backup your data and click the `OPEN BACKUPS` button.
From there, find your newest backup folder, open it, and delete the Mods folder (this is to prevent potentially old or incompatible mods from breaking your game).

Afterwards, go back to the menu and press the circular arrows located beside your latest backup. This is to restore your scores.
The button is highlighted in the image [here](#installing-bmbf-with-sidequest).

## Installing mods from your PC

:::warning
Make sure your quest and PC are on the same network!
:::

Open BMBF in your Quest and go to the `Tools` tab, there you should see a web address and a version number similar to what's show below.

![ip](./images/beginners-guide/ip.png)

On your PC, open your browser and type the address into the search bar.

You should be greeted with this screen below.

![bmbfweb](./images/beginners-guide/bmbfweb.png)

Now just drag any Quest compatible mods into the upload box and sync. If the mod was originally made for an older version, then it won't automatically enable. To enable an old mod, go to the `Mods` tab and enable it from there.

If you want to use the same method of downloading songs as you do in BMBF in your Quest, just replace `upload` in the URL with `browser`.
