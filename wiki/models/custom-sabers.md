# Custom Sabers
## Installation
The latest Custom Saber plugin can be found in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest). The custom sabers mod can also be found on [BMBF](https://bsmg.wiki/quest-modding.html). Run ModAssistant, select the Custom Saber plugin, and click Install.
Once you've installed it you will see a folder called `CustomSabers` in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md), this is where you should place the `*.saber` files you want to use. You can download more sabers on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Sabers/).

## Usage
Inside the game in the main menu you will see a button called `CUSTOM SABERS` at the top left of the Mods menu over by the release notes. Clicking that will open up the menu you can use to select which sabers you want to use. Note that once selected the sabers will show up only while a song is playing, and not while in a menu. 

## Creating Sabers
[MissRaynor's Saber Guide](https://bs.assistant.moe/Sabers) is an excellent resource for learning how to make your own sabers.
