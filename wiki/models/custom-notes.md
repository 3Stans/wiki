# Custom Notes

## Installation

The latest Custom Notes plugin can be found in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest) or in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) on the BSMG Discord.

Once installed, you should see a `CustomNotes` folder in your [Beat Saber install directory](/faq/install-folder.md), with some sample notes installed for you. This folder is also where you will place `.bloq` files.

You can download more bloqs from [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Bloqs/).

## Creating Custom Notes

[Bobbie's Bloq Guide](https://bs.assistant.moe/Bloqs/) is a good resource for creating custom notes from an existing model.

Note that this guide does not cover 3D modeling the notes. For that, we recommend looking up some tutorials on [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)!
