# Custom Notes
## Installation
The latest Custom Notes plugin can be found in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest) or in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) on the BSMG discord.
Once installed, you should see a `CustomNotes` folder, with some sample notes installed for you. This folder is also where you will place `.bloq` files. You can download bloqs from [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Bloqs/).

## Creating Custom Notes
[Bobbie's Bloq Guide](https://bs.assistant.moe/Bloqs/) is a good resource for creating custom notes (this guide does NOT cover 3D modeling the notes).
