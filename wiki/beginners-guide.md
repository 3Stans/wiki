# Beginners Guide

## Modding your Game
Beat Saber is available for both PC and Oculus Quest. Since the modding scene is different for both platforms, there are two different ways to set it up.  

**PC**  
The following guide will help you set up [Modding for PC.](./pc-modding.md)  

**Quest**  
The following guide will help you set up [Modding for Quest.](./quest-modding.md)
## Exploring content
With a modded game, you can now explore the creations of others!  
There is a lot that can be done with mods but take your time and try things out slowly. It is easy to get overwhelmed with a bunch of new settings when you don't know what they do in game.
### Maps
Use the following sites to search, explore and download new maps:  
  * [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/browse/hot)  
  * [BeastSaber](https://bsaber.com/)

It is recommened to stay away from filtering songs by "Top All", "Rating", "Downloads" and "Plays". Most maps in those sort filters were made before this wiki was created and there were no mapping standards. Try downloading songs from between late 2019 and now to get the best experiance in game.
