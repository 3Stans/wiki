# Custom Notes
## Installation

translation-done: false

Once installed, you should see a `CustomNotes` folder in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md), with some sample notes installed for you. This folder is also where you will place `*.bloq` files.

You can download more bloqs from [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Bloqs/).

## Usage
Inside the game in the main menu you will see a `CUSTOM NOTES` button at the top left of the Mods menu over by the release notes. Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which notes you want to use.

## Creating Custom Notes

[Bobbie's Bloq Guide](/models/notes-guide.html) is a good resource for creating custom notes from an existing model.

Note that this guide does not cover 3D modeling the notes. For that, we recommend looking up some tutorials on [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)!
